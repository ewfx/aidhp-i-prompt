## 🎯 Introduction
Our application is a highly personalized credit card recommendation system that leverages advanced clustering algorithms like K-Means and DBSCAN, combined with the Gemma 3 1B LLM, to generate valuable insights. Our application provides tailored credit card recommendations based on user profiles and spending behavior. With a plug-and-play architecture, it can be seamlessly deployed at any scale.

## 💡 Inspiration
Traditional credit card recommendation systems often fail to consider user-specific needs, leading to suboptimal suggestions. We wanted to bridge the gap by integrating AI-driven clustering with a powerful LLM to provide meaningful insights. Our aim was to create a scalable, intelligent, and data-driven solution that adapts to evolving customer preferences.

## ⚙️ What It Does
📊 User Profiling & Clustering – Utilizes K-Means & DBSCAN to cluster users based on their financial behavior.
🧠 LLM-Based Insights – Gemma 3 1B generates personalized insights based on user spending patterns.
🔄 Database CRUD Operations – A dedicated database service ensures efficient storage and retrieval of user data.
📡 Plug & Play Model – Can be easily integrated with existing banking infrastructures.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
Briefly outline the technologies, frameworks, and tools used in development.

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
LLM Integration: Ensuring smooth and real-time interaction between the LLM and recommendation system.
Generating Accurate Synthetic Data – Creating realistic synthetic user transaction data for testing and model training.
Integrating All Services – Ensuring seamless communication between the clustering models, LLM, database service, and frontend.
